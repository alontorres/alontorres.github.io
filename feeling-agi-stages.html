            <p class="post-date">Posted on July 30, 2024</p> <!-- Placeholder Date -->

            <section id="introduction">
                <p>As I've journeyed deeper into understanding Artificial General Intelligence, I've noticed a pattern in my own evolving reactions â€“ and I suspect I'm not alone. From dismissal to dawning awareness, and finally to a sense of profound shift, the process can be disorienting. I've tried to capture this in 'The 5 Stages of Feeling the AGI,' not as a rigid diagnostic tool, but as a shared map for those of us trying to make sense of this unprecedented moment. Perhaps you'll recognize parts of your own journey here.</p>

                <h3>The 5 Stages</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>AI is useless, overhyped vaporware like crypto.</li>
                    <li>It's just a stochastic parrot - It has its uses, but could never do my job.</li>
                    <li>Alright, it's a big deal like the invention of the printing press or the internet. New roles will emerge and productivity will go up. We'll handle it.</li>
                    <li>This is going to be a fundamental reshaping of society, but if I get really good at using it, I'll be fine!</li>
                    <li>AI isn't our next chapter. It's a new book, written in a language we don't speak. All bets are off.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

                <h3>Conclusion/Call to Reflection</h3>
                <p>Recognizing these stages in oneself, or in the discourse around AI, isn't about inducing panic. It's about fostering self-awareness and opening up conversations. Where do you see yourself, or society, in these stages? More importantly, how can we move towards constructive engagement with the immense uncertainties and possibilities AGI presents, regardless of which stage we're in? The 'Oh, SHIT.' moment (or whatever your Stage 5 feels like) isn't an end point, but perhaps a necessary gateway to truly grappling with what's ahead.</p>
