## Hello, world.

It was early April this year when I stumbled upon [AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/) - a detailed, month-by-month forecast of where AI might be heading, put together by people with serious credentials: Scott Alexander of the Astral Codex Ten blog, AI safety researchers Daniel Kokotajlo (formerly OpenAI, MIRI) and Thomas Larsen (Center for AI Policy, MIRI), Eli Lifland, a gifted forecaster ranked first on RAND's Forecasting Initiative, and Romeo Dean, who specializes in AI chip forecasting and is an AI Policy Fellow at the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy. They basically sat down and mapped out a plausible, if pretty sobering, scenario of how AI development could accelerate and what that might mean for us in the very near future.

Reading through their work was like a switch flipping in my brain. Seriously, the gears started *grinding*. AI, which I'd always seen as this amazing, optimistic field I was keenly following, suddenly felt... different. It morphed into this huge question mark, a source of unease and a kind of worry I'd never really experienced before. I can't stress this enough - I really think everyone should take a look at what they're forecasting. It deserves our attention.

Since then, I've gone deep down the rabbit hole. I've spent countless hours watching interviews, soaking up conversations with top AI researchers and people working right at the heart of the big AI labs today.

And honestly? The conclusions I've come to are pretty terrifying.

But hereâ€™s the thing: I genuinely believe our best chance - maybe our only real shot - at steering things away from the worst-case scenarios is to talk about it. We need to get the word out about the potential dangers AI could pose, how incredibly unprepared we seem to be as a society, and, most importantly, what each of us, in our own small ways, can actually *do* to help.

Those are the core messages I'm hoping to share with you all here. It's a heavy topic, I know, but I think it's one we need to face together.
