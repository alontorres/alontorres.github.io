## The five stages of 'Feeling the AGI'

1. AI is useless, overhyped vaporware like crypto.
2. It's just a stochastic parrot - It has its uses, but could never do my job.
3. Alright, it's a big deal like the invention of the printing press or the internet. New roles will emerge and productivity will go up. We'll handle it.
4. This is going to be a fundamental reshaping of society, but if I get really good at using it, I'll be fine!
5. AI isn't our next chapter. It's a new book, written in a language we don't speak. All bets are off.
