            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Alon Torres. I've been an SRE at Google for the past 8 years, living in Seattle, WA. I've recently started 'feeling the AGI'...</p>
            <p>This sense of an uncertain, rapidly accelerating future isn't meant to be paralyzing. Instead, I believe it's a call for greater collective awareness and discussion. This website is my small contribution to that effort â€“ a place to share my evolving thoughts, process the 'existential crises' (big and small), and hopefully encourage others to explore these critical questions too. We need more open, honest dialogue about what this technology means for all of us.</p>
