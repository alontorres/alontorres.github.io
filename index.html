            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Alon Torres. I've been an SRE at Google for the past 8 years, living in Seattle, WA. I've recently started 'feeling the AGI' and I think it's morally imperative that others become more aware of how the near future will be very uncertain, full of changes coming out at a rate we've never seen before.</p>

                <p>I've recently started 'feeling the AGI' and I think it's morally imperative that others become more aware of how the near future will be very uncertain, full of changes coming out at a rate we've never seen before.

                    <li>AI is useless, overhyped vaporware like crypto.</li>
                    <li>It's just a stochastic parrot - It has its uses, but could never do my job.</li>
                    <li>Alright, it's a big deal like the invention of the printing press or the internet. New roles will emerge and productivity will go up. We'll handle it.</li>
                    <li>This is going to be a fundamental reshaping of society, but if I get really good at using it, I'll be fine!</li>
                    <li>AI isn't our next chapter. It's a new book, written in a language we don't speak. All bets are off.</li>
